Bugs:
- [x] The reset does not work after a `stop`
- [x] It is using the cell state from the previous rendered state;
- [x] Adjust the width and height of Canvas;
- [x] Websocket looks like not working properly(what probably is happening is that whenever I refresh the page the WS is not being reset and therefore we find ourselves having broken pipe errors)
- [x] When hitting reset key, if the game is running, it will go to iteration 1 and not 0
- [x] When refresh button is pressed, if I had a certain speed, it is going to maintain the same speed, but the input range is not going to be updated

Features:
- [x] Add possibility of changing the speed of which the game is going to be rendered;
- [x] Add possibility of selecting the grids squares (cells) with a mouse, so we decide which are the alive or dead cells;
- [x] Toggle cell live/dead;
- [x] Add possibility of starting the game with different pre-built models;
- [x] Add gosper glider gun 
- [x] Add iteration counter
- [x] Add Dockerfile/Docker compose and check GitHub pages to maybe host it 

Improvements:
- [x] Use variables that come from the backend
- [x] Add some restrictions on the application (example: do not allow to choose a pattern if the game is running)
- [x] Reset state of pattern components
- [x] Remove WARN logger (change to DEBUG)
- [x] Reset the iteration counter whenever we change patterns
