Bugs:
- [x] The reset does not work after a `stop`
- [x] It is using the cell state from the previous rendered state;
- [x] Adjust the width and height of Canvas;
- [ ] Websocket looks like not working properly(what probably is happening is that whenever I refresh the page the WS is not being reset and therefore we find ourselves having broken pipe errors)

Features:
- [x] Add possibility of changing the speed of which the game is going to be rendered;
- [x] Add possibility of selecting the grids squares (cells) with a mouse, so we decide which are the alive or dead cells;
- [x] Toggle cell live/dead;
- [x] Add possibility of starting the game with different pre-built models;
- [ ] Add gosper glider gun

Improvements:
- [x] Use variables that come from the backend
- [x] Add some restrictions on the application (example: do not allow to choose a pattern if the game is running)
- [x] Reset state of pattern componenets
